# TakeaLook
The project consists in a development of a Mobile application that allows to people with few resources to get a prescription glasses. The principal goal is resolve a basic need for many people, that is often left uncovered due to economic factors and social gaps. Through the development of the application, we want to strengthen the bond in the community and allow to the donors and the establishments help another with a digital platform. Likewise using the development software offered by Android Studio, we will create a mobile application for devices that use the Android operating system. Made by the geolocation of the devices, we will show in a map the location of the different optics and an index card that contains the main information. With this the users can see the available establishments and contact them to make or receive donations. Furthermore, we will create a professional area where the optics can manage the donations they receive. With the development of this application we want to promote the participation of the parts implicated to improve the society. Thanks to self-management and a mobile application, many people who currently cannot afford a prescription glasses, can cover a basic need for their daily life.
